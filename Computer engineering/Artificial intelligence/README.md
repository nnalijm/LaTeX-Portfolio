## [Fuzzy logic](https://github.com/nnalijm/LaTeX-Portfolio/tree/main/Computer%20engineering/Artificial%20intelligence/sprawozdanie1)

The laboratory consists of three main parts. Part I aims to familiarize you with the synthesis method fuzzy Mamdani-type expert system using the [scikit-fuzzy library](https://pythonhosted.org/scikit-fuzzy/overview.html). In part II, you should get acquainted with the idea of Mamdani's system and then modify the system performed in part I. Part III of the laboratory involves completing an example final task

## Khepera mobile robot

### Obstacle avoidance task

The aim of the exercise is to learn how to synthesize a role-playing expert system regulator. The fuzzy expert system will be used to control the small [mobile robot Khepera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khepera_mobile_robot) performing the task of avoiding obstacles.

The laboratory consists of three main parts. Part I aims to familiarize you with the structure and how to control the Khepera III mobile robot using dedicated Python functions. IN part II, a Mamdani-type [expert system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system) will be designed using the library scikit-learn performing the task of avoiding obstacles. Part III of the lab is hands-on verifying the correctness of the implemented system in controlling a real robot.
